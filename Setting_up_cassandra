To install Cassandra, this installation will use Ubuntu Linux either running on a virtual machine or as the host operating system.

To set up Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine:

1. Downnload Oracle VirtualBox.
   https://www.virtualbox.org/

2. Download the Ubuntu Linux .iso file.
   https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

3. When VirtualBox is installed and the iso file is downloaded, open VirtualBox and press "New".

4. Create a name for the virtual machine, select Linux as the type, and Ubuntu as the version.

5. Double-click on the machine once it's created, and choose to add a file to load the ubuntu iso file
   when the option appears in the window.
   
6. Set-up Ubuntu. Restart Ubuntu by setting down the machine and then opening it again.

7. After signing into Ubuntu Linux after opening the machine again, and go to the sidebar or search for
   Terminal.
   
8. Open Terminal.

10. The first step is to install the correct version of Java that Cassandra runs on (either Java 7 or 8), the vim text editor, and curl:
          
          To download Java, type in the terminal with elevated priviledges:
          
          sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
          
          To download vim, type in the terminal:
          
          sudo apt-get install vim
          
          To download curl, type in the terminal:
          
          sudo apt-get install curl
          
11. Create the JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME environment variables, and set them to the path; all of them should be set 
    permanently within the .bashrc profile for convenience:
    
    Go to and edit the .bashrc file with texteditor vim by typing:
    
     vi ~/.bashrc
     
     Scroll to the bottom of the file. If you have not already done so, press the 'Insert' button on
     your keyboard to able to edit the file. At the bottom of the file, type:
     
     export JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64'
     export JRE_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre'
     
     (or wherever the the 'jvm' folder is downloaded)
     
     To exit the texteditor, type:
     
     :q
     
12. To install Cassandra now, go to and copy and paste the steps into your terminal at the home folder
    (though the location for this step doesn't actually matter; it just depends where you want the files
     downloaded)
     
     Type (or copy and paste) the commands found on Cassandra's site for install under the 
     subheader "Installation for Debian packages" (Ubuntu is a strain of Debian Linux). The website
     can be found here:
     
     https://cassandra.apache.org/download/
     
13. After following the steps on Cassandra's website, you should have Cassandra installed on your
    virtual machine. Congratulations!
